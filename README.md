# kernel_skb_path
It is the skb path of Linux kernel. I would like enlarge the flow always.


Because I want to focus on the skb path from the lay 2 to socket layer, so the driver is not that I care about. I just selected the intel's e1000 driver to explain the NAPI. 



There are two reasons as following
1. Intel's driver is more clear than other vendor's.   
2. The e1000 driver is most simplest and is enough to show the NAPI
